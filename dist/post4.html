                        <p>The documentaion for this week includes how I used the Other Milling Machine to create a box. Below is a picture of the final output. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/assg4_box.jpg"/></a>
                        <p>I started with drafting how the box should look like. There are 3 main things that I need to take into consideration. First is the size of the FR1 board; second is the size of the different surfaces of the box; third is the dimension of the T bone. Eventually, I decided that the size of the t bone will be 4mm * 2mm with a portruding circle that has a diameter of 1 mm. I kept the extruding and intruding parts at the same width, which eventually caused me lots of trouble. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/assg4_draft.jpg"/></a>
                        <p>To make it digital, I drew out the shapes in Adobe Illustrator. Next, I converted the file to Rhino so I could mesure the sizes of each piece. At this step, I made the mistake of extruding the shapes, which I later found out was unnecessary when I was using Bantam. Then I added a text and created a saparate layer for it. I hid one layer first and "exported selected" so I got 2 individual DXF files for the outline and the engraving. <br>
                            Afterwards, I followed the instructions on the slide and used KidCad to make some adustments and converted the fiile to gbr format. For the engraving, I set the line width as 0.3 mm. <br> 
                            Lastly, I went to the Mill and opened up Bantam to prepare for milling. I measured the height of a FR1 board first, and then I pasted them together and measured the height again to calculate the offset number. Afterwards, I joggled the bed and adjusted both x and y to zero. <br> 
                            Everything was ready and I started milling. Unfortunately, the bit fractured so I had to stop and install a new one. It's important to select "install tool" and "rehome" after installing a new bit, which I missed at first </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/assg4_install.jpg"/></a>
                        <p>After making all the adjustments, I successfully milled the outlines of the box. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/assg4_first.jpg" width="70%" alt="" class="center"/></a> <br>
                        <p> However, I realized that the extruding and intruding parts didn't fit together. Therefore, I made adjustments in my Rhino file and decreased the width of the extruding part by about 8% and I milled again. Unfortunately, they still didn't fit. I discarded a lot of FR1 boards before I eventually decided to decrease the width by a total of 20%. They were still pretty tight, so I had to press super hard for them to fit. </p> 
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/assg4_discard.jpg" width="70%" alt="" class="center"/></a>
                        <p>I'm glad it eventually worked out after multiple trial and error. It's still very confusing why I had to decrease the width by 20% for the parts to fit.</p>
